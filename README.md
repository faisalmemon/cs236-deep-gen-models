# README
This repository contains some rough lecture notes from CS236 Deep Generative Models.

I haven't tried to be comprehensive or authorative.  The real motivation here is an excuse to get into the habit of using Latex and other documentation strategies for technical (in particular mathematical content).
Eventually, when I start publicly sharing results, I hope this provides me the needed grounding!

So at the moment, this repository is not much use to anyone else.  I am just making it public just in case it evolves into something useful.
